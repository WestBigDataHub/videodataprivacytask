## Tutorials

The Jupyter Notebook tutorials are intended to help learn concepts relevant to the driver video challenge competition. They can also be a good review for anyone who has had experience working with video data or driver video data in the past.

More notebooks will be added throughout the competition. The sections below will explain how to run the jupyter notebooks although it is recommended to use the provided JupyterHub links which allow the notebooks to be run in your browser without additional setup. It is also an option to set up Jupyter locally which is explained on the GitHub Page.
