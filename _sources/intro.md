## Why do some drivers crash?

The lifetime odds for dying in a car crash are <b>1 in 107</b>. Each year, vehicle crashes cost <b>hundreds of billions of dollars</b>. Research shows that <b>driver behavior</b> is a primary factor in â…” of crashes and a contributing factor in 90% of crashes. However, driver behavior is one of the most difficult things to study. 

<b>In-cabin video data</b> has the potential to enhance our understanding and provide greater context for interpretation, but brings forward important questions about responsible data science and the future of research.


## We Need Your Help!

The goal of this video data task is to explore methods for obscuring driver identity in driver-facing video recordings while preserving human behavioral information. 

The annotated data for this task from Oak Ridge National Laboratory will be available to registered participants. To read more about the data see the [](./aboutdata.md) page.


## Getting Started
