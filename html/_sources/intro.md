# <b>Driving Road Safety Forward: Video Data Privacy</b>


## Why do some drivers crash?

The lifetime odds for dying in a car crash are <b>1 in 107</b>. Each year, vehicle crashes cost <b>hundreds of billions of dollars</b>. Research shows that <b>driver behavior</b> is a primary factor in â…” of crashes and a contributing factor in 90% of crashes. However, driver behavior is one of the most difficult things to study. 

<b>In-cabin video data</b> has the potential to enhance our understanding and provide greater context for interpretation, but brings forward important questions about responsible data science and the future of research. The goal of this video data task is to explore methods for obscuring driver identity in driver-facing video recordings while preserving human behavioral information.

## The Task

The goal of this video data task is to explore methods for obscuring driver identity in driver-facing video recordings while preserving human behavioral information.

The <b>SHRP 2 dataset</b> was collected as part of the <b>Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS)</b> and contains <b>millions of hours and petabytes of driver video data</b> that can be used by researchers to gain a better understanding about the underlying causes of car crashes.

The dataset is currently <b>hosted in a secure enclave</b> due to privacy concerns about the identities of the drivers used in the study. The data studied in this challenge is similar to the SHRP 2 dataset but the privacy concerns and participant submissions are applicable in a much broader context of the driver safety research community.
